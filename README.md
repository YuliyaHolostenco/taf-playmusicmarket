TEST AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK (UI/API TESTING)

**UI/API TESTING** [PLAYMUSICMARKET](https://stage.playmusicmarket.store "PLAYMUSICMARKET")  is clone live website that is used for testing changes before making them live.

**PLAYMUSICMARKET** is a music streaming, music retail (download), talent discovery and fan engagement platform that allows everyone - content creators and consumers - to make a living from music.

I was involved in building Automation framework that can be used by any engineer to build reliable tests with great code coverage, aligned to company "PLAYMUSICMARKET" needs.

**When creating the Test Automation Framework, I consider the following main points:**

-To be able to create automated tests quickly by using appropriate abstraction layers;

-The framework should have meaningful logging and reporting structure;

-Should be easily maintainable and extendable;

-Should be simple enough for testers to write automated tests;

-A retry mechanism to rerun failed tests - this is especially useful for WebDriver UI and REST Assured tests.
